  	<h3>Appropriator</h3>
		<h4>Project Type:</h4>
		iOS for iPad and iPhone
		<h4>Year Completed:</h4>
		In progress
		<h4>About:</h4>
  		Over the past century, from Marcel Duchamp's readymades to Andy Warhol's iconic screen prints, artists and designers have increasingly appropriated elements from previously constructed symbols or objects into their own work. Carrying on in this tradition, <em>Appropriator</em> incorporates iconic paintings into the iPhone and iPad, providing the user with a library of selected elements from famous paintings throughout history. The user may use the device's camera to snap a photo or import a pre-existing photo from the photo library and embellish this personal image with one or more painting elements from Appropriator's library. The elements are moveable, scalable, and rotatable so that they fit perfectly into the user's image. The resulting image can be shared.
